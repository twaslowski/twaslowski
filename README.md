## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on DevOps based in Hamburg, Germany.

I'm passionate about Open Source and am always working on one pet project or another;
currently I am developing [grammr](https://github.com/twaslowski/grammr), an open
language-learning software supporting a variety of primarily Indo-Germanic languages.

I have also written a Telegram-based, highly customizable [Mood Tracker](https://github.com/twaslowski/open-mood-tracker)
that can be used as part of behavioural therapy for people working with a variety of mood disorders, or
for anyone trying to reach a higher degree of emotional intelligence.

For more details, my CV is hosted on Github Pages and can be found [here](https://twaslowski.github.io/cv/main.pdf).
