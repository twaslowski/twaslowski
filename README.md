## Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on DevOps based in Hamburg, Germany.
You can usually find me working on one or several passion projects at any given time.
Here's a few cool ones:

## [Pulselog](https://pulselog.me)

A flexible mental health tracker with custom metrics, frictionless data entry, and insightful visualizations. 
Track anything from mood and energy to medication effects and chronic pain patterns. Designed to be the tracker you'll actually keep using.
You can find the source code at [twaslowski/pulselog](https://github.com/twaslowski/pulselog).

## [grammr](https://grammr.app)

Imagine a translator meeting a dictionary meeting study notes: You can translate sentences,
understand the translations in-depth in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Additionally, you
get to generate conjugation and declension tables **and** create and study your own flashcards!

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/twaslowski/grammr-serverless).
