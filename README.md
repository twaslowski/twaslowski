## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on DevOps based in Hamburg, Germany.
You can usually find me working on one or several passion projects at any given time.
Here's a few cool ones:

## [grammr](https://grammr.app)

Imagine a translator meeting a dictionary meeting study notes: You can translate sentences,
understand the translations in-depth in terms of vocabulary and grammar, and store everything
you would like to remember as flashcards to later study in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

You can find the source code here: [Link](https://github.com/twaslowski/grammr).

## [moody](https://moody.twaslowski.com)

I have also written a Telegram-based, highly customizable [Mood Tracker](https://github.com/twaslowski/open-mood-tracker)
that can be used as part of behavioural therapy for people working with a variety of mood disorders, or
for anyone trying to reach a higher degree of emotional intelligence.

For more details, my CV is hosted on Github Pages and can be found [here](https://twaslowski.github.io/cv/main.pdf).
